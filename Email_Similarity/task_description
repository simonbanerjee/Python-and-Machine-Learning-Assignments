Email Similarity
In this project, you will use scikit-learn’s Naive Bayes implementation on several different datasets. By reporting the accuracy of the classifier, we can find which datasets are harder to distinguish. For example, how difficult do you think it is to distinguish the difference between emails about hockey and emails about soccer? How hard is it to tell the difference between emails about hockey and emails about tech? In this project, we’ll find out exactly how difficult those two tasks are.
