Welcome to Part 2 of the Twitch Project. In this part of the project, you will be taking your findings from the SQL queries and visualize them using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

Bar Graph: Featured Games
Pie Chart: Stream Viewersâ€™ Locations
Line Graph: Time Series Analysis
The Twitch Science Team provided this practice dataset. You can download the .csv files (800,000 rows) from GitHub.
